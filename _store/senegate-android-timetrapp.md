Stop documenting the time used for tasks days or weeks after you have actually done them. TimeTrapp allows you to record your time anywhere you go. The data is stored on your smartphone and stays where it belongs: under your control. However TimeTrapp also supports Kimai and Kimai 2 as backend, so it is also possible to feed the data into a centralized system.
